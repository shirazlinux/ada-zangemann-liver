mother and her little brother, Alan, in a cabin near a junkyard on the edge of town.

					attached only with its wires.
					On the left, in front of the car, there are two tires, two boxes – one
					of which is a wooden box with an overturned bucket –, and an empty can,
					all among some plants with yellow flowers.
					In the background there is Ada's house, with her mother and her brother
					Alan waving goodbye, and the dog sitting on the ground.
					Alan is sitting on the two entrance steps of the house. He has short
					dark hair and is dressed in a white short-sleeved shirt with a red
					stripe at the edges of the sleeves and two red stripes at the bottom of
					the shirt. Alan wears blue shorts and he is barefoot.
					Ada's mom has dark lipstick and long black hair in a white headband. She
					is wearing a short blue shirt with white trim, white pants, and yellow
					shoes.
					Ada's house is built of wood, with the front being white. The roof is
					dark red corrugated sheeting. There are two windows in front in addition
					to the door, and another window on the left side. A yellow duck stands
					on top of the roof, while a gray chimney protrudes. An antenna on the
					left of the roof supports a clothesline on which red clothespins hold a
					green tank top, a pair of light blue pants, and white underpants. To the
					right of the house there is a veranda on which there is installed a
					solar panel. Under the veranda there are a mattress, a red oil drum, and
					a gray case.
					Behind the house there are piles of landfill objects among which you can
					see a washing machine, a car, and various wooden boards.  (end of description) </div>

						Far away, at the other end of town, lived a famous inventor named
Zangemann.  He was immensely rich. No sheet of paper in the world was
big enough to show his bank balance with all its numbers and zeros! He
lived in a huge house with a swimming pool and waterslide, lots of
staircases and towers, hundreds of windows, and so many rooms that he
often got lost in them himself. Zangemann’s mansion stood high on a
hill. From there, he could look out over the whole city.

When he was young, computers were huge machines with lots   
of cables and loud, noisy fans. At school, little Zangemann often 
dreamed of all the things he would do with computers if they were just a 
little bit smaller — small enough that they could be built into other 
fun things.</span>

come six bubbles in which there are his ideas of places in which to 
insert computers: a video call system, a speaker, a washing machine, a 
skateboard with radio control on a big computer monitor, a wrist 
computer, and a shoulder computer with a monitor and keyboard.
Zangemann has gray hair, a dark purple shirt with blue horizontal 
stripes, blue shorts, brown shoes and white socks. He wears glasses and 
a big watch on his left wrist.
On the table there are an open notebook, a yellow pencil, and an eraser, 
while hanging on the side of the table there is his brown briefcase. (end of description)  </div>

					<p class="back-yellow">
						<span class="alinea">First, he would build a computer 
into his skateboard so that it would make cool noises when he rode it — 
maybe a fire engine siren or the sound of a rocket launch. Then he would 
use a computer to invent ice‑cream-making machines! The computer would 
mix the coolest flavors and even sell the ice cream. There would be 
machines on every street corner, and he could get ice cream in his 
favorite flavor whenever he felt like it, and just as much as he wanted. 
After that, he’d build a cleaning robot and a block-sorting machine so 
that his room would always be neat and clean. Zangemann had great new 
ideas like these every day. He could think of nothing else.

							As the years went by, Zangemann grew bigger and computers got smaller. 
In fact, by the time he finished school, they were so small they fit in 
his pocket. The smallest ones even fit on his fingertip.

						“Finally, I can turn all my ideas into real things!” Zangemann

computers into all kinds of things to make them even more fun and 
useful. And then he sold them.

to choose the flavor, and the hole for returning coins.
At the top there is a round white sign with a scoop of candy-pink ice

						Adults and children loved his inventions. All the kids wanted to have one of his skateboards — complete with the latest sounds to show off to 
their friends at school. Kids also loved his speaker invention, which 
could instantly play any song you requested. And, of course, everyone 
loved the ice cream served every afternoon from the automatic, 
extra-delicious Original Zangemann Ice Cream Machine. It all seemed like 
magic, but the secret was simple: the little computers that Zangemann 
built into his machines made it all possible.

						Luckily, Ada lived right next to the junkyard. There were lots of broken 
gadgets and rusty parts, which she put together to make cool new things, 
like a soapbox she and Alan rode roaring down the hill, a windmill, and 
scary junk monsters, which she and Alan would fight together. She also 
found many useful items—an old cell phone, for example. The screen was 
cracked, but she could fix that, and while there wasn’t internet at the 
junkyard, she could get access somewhere else.

					Because everyone bought his inventions, Zangemann soon became the 
richest person in the whole world. With all his money, he bought a huge 
golden computer with a keyboard made of jewels and set it up in the 
largest room of his mansion. From there, over the internet, he could 
control all the little computers built into his inventions.

		<div id="page-18" class="ada-page">
				<p class="back-light-green">
				All he had to do was press the proper key on the golden computer, and 
immediately all the ice-cream machines in town would dispense only 
vanilla ice cream. If Zangemann wanted people to eat chocolate ice 
cream, he pressed the key for chocolate ice cream. If he gave the order 
for lemon ice cream, the machines made only lemon ice cream. Zangemann 
loved his inventions and was always thrilled at how amazingly well his 
machines worked. Sometimes people were disappointed when their favorite 
flavor wasn’t available, but what could they do? After all, there was 
ice cream on every street corner.

long telescope, observing how reliably his  
inventions carried out his commands.</span>

		<div id="page-21" class="ada-page">

					When he wasn’t sitting at his golden computer, Zangemann was building 
his little computers into new devices and then selling those. He built 
washing machines that sent a message to your cell phone when your 
laundry was done.  He made vacuums that played happy music instead of 
droning loudly. He invented light bulbs that turned on and off at the 
snap of a finger and cars that told you where the nearest grocery store 
was.

		<div id="page-22" class="ada-page">
				<p class="back-yellow">
				Soon, almost every appliance in the world had a Zangemann computer built 
into it. Not all of his inventions seemed necessary at first, but people 
bought everything he made. That’s just the way it was. Everyone wanted 
the devices made by Zangemann, the greatest inventor in the world.

school was forgotten. The skateboards  
still didn’t go on the sidewalk, but  
apart from that, they still worked.  
And so now the children rode in  
circles around the playground and  
listened to soft music. Only a strange,  
pompous marching music continued  
to play at an unchanged volume, which  
the children found rather puzzling.</span>

pick her up from school, and they would all go to the library together.   
Ada was always drawn to the technology section. There were books with 
blueprints, instructions for experiments, and explanations of how 
different devices worked. In the library, Ada could also go online with 
her cell phone. She quickly realized that there was also much to 
discover on the internet. There, many people shared their ideas and 
repair tips to help others.</span>

				<span class="alinea">On one of those afternoons, Ada learned two new words: hardware and 
software.  Hardware was a word for something Ada already knew: the 
electronic devices she tinkered with after school, or those devices she 
could hold in her hands and try to fix or make into something else. What 
was completely new to Ada was the word software. She soon learned that 
it meant instructions that ran on a computer to control other devices or 
computers. Some books called those instructions programs or code. With 
such a computer program, one could, for example, tell a loudspeaker 
which song to play and how loud.</span>

tinker with software just as she could with hardware. Hardware is built 
with tools — hammers, drills, and screws. Software is built simply by 
writing down the commands for the hardware, one after the other. There 
was a separate language for this — the programming language. With 
software, Ada could make her inventions even more useful. She really 
wanted to learn the programming language!

				With each passing day, more and more children and adults joined the 
protest.  The bus driver they had helped drove up in her bus. She honked 
loudly to attract even more people to the protest. The custodian brought 
a few friends, and Toni’s father brought his colleagues from work, all 
wearing perfectly ironed ties. Even Ms. Gernet came. The crowd grew, and 
after a few weeks, there were protests not just in Ada’s city but also 
in many cities throughout the country.

pouring rain. On one such rainy day, when the president passed the group   
of dripping-wet children, he couldn’t help but admire their 
stubbornness. He asked Ada, “Why do you sit here every day? What do you 
want to achieve?” Ada replied, “We want to determine for ourselves what 
we can and cannot do with our computers.” Her friends shouted in unison: 
“Don’t wreck our tech! Don’t wreck our tech!” and “We want the code! We 
want the code!”

					<span class="alinea">The president looked at the determined faces of the children. Honestly, 
he, too, wanted to decide for himself what the government could and 
couldn’t do with its computers. But he didn’t understand anything about 
computers and code, so he had always left that to Zangemann. Deep in 
thought, the president entered the building.</span>

			The next day, the president invited Ada and her friends over. “We also 
want to be in charge of our software ourselves. In order for that to be 
true, the government must be independent from Zangemann. Can you tell me 
what you know about computer programs?” he asked them. Enthusiastically, 
they explained to him how software works and what you could do with it. 
The president was amazed.

Ada is reprogramming the President's computer.
Toni is setting up a speaker for the President's secretary.
Marie and Konrad are sitting on the floor and talking, and Marie has a 
laptop on her legs with an FSFE logo sticker (three stars: pea green, 
sky blue, and sea blue).
On the floor are a bowl with candy and a plate with ice creams.
The President's phone is ringing, but nobody is answering. One of Ada's friends lying on his stomach with one foot up in the 
air is typing on a laptop. He has wavy brown hair parted in the center, 
a red sweatshirt, blue pants, and white socks but no shoes. Next to the 
computer there are a green cup and two open books.  (end of description) </div>

software, the way it wanted — completely without Zangemann. Immediately, 
the president called his advisers. In a large group, they discussed with 
the children everything they could change and improve in the software.</span>

finally happened! Their long protest was worth it.</span>

Zangemann. He was angrier than ever. “Without me, the government   
computers will no longer work,” he threatened. But the president kept 
the call short and quickly hung up. The phone rang many more times that 
day, but Zangemann’s calls went unanswered. The president sat in a 
meeting with Ada, Toni, Marie, Konrad, and the government experts.</span>

first programs for the government’s computers. They were no longer disturbed  
by Zangemann’s calls. Toni had the good idea of reprogramming  
the telephones. When Zangemann called, he  
only heard an automated recording: “The  
government only wants to use software  
that it can freely use, study, share, and  
improve. Thank you for calling.”</span>
			
				Then, after many weeks of protests and  
discussions, the time had finally come:  
they abolished the old Zangemann law!  
Instead, the government announced:

angrily in front of his golden computer. Maybe he doesn’t dare go out   
into the street anymore and has boarded up all the windows of his 
mansion so that he doesn’t have to worry about what other people are 
doing with his inventions. But maybe he also sometimes looks out into 
the world through his telescope and sees what the children are inventing
